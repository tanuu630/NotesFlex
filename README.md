My React Project
This project was created using Create React App as the foundation. Itâ€™s a fully functional React application designed to be highly responsive and interactive.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

npm start
This command runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload whenever you make changes. Any lint errors will also be displayed in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information about running tests, check out the Create React App test docs.

npm run build
Builds the app for production in the build folder. It optimizes the build for the best performance and correctly bundles React for production mode. The build is minified and filenames include hashes, ensuring your app is ready for deployment.

For more details on deployment, check out the Create React App deployment documentation.
